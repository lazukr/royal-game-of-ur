# Royal Game of Ur

This is an ancient race game played during the time of an early civilization known as Sumer. You can read more about this game in Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur). 

## Gameplay

This game involves two players trying to get all seven stones across the path before their opponent. The path that each stone takes is kind of hard to explain so I will put up an image that will explain that eventually.

### Rules
- Each turn, you roll the slot machine and add up the number you get from it. That is the amount of tiles you can choose to move one of your stone.
- You can either choose to move an existing stone or put a new one on the board.
- At any of the petal-like tile, you are protected from the enemy and you get to move again. This can be chained indefinitely as long as you keep landing the on the petal-like tiles.
- If the tile that you land on is occupied by the opponent, you can take it off the board and your opponent will have to retry the whole path for that stone.
- When coming off the board, you must get the exact amount needed to just get off.
- In any case where the previous sets of rules prevent you from making a move at all, your turn is skipped.
